Trading system bitarb/bitarb.go conducts cryptocurrency arbitrage across Bitfinex, OKCoin USD, OKCoin CNY, and BTC China. Position management is fully automated. The system is functional and can be run autonomously but is not intended as a turn-key system for general use. 

Configuration settings are in bitarb/bitarb.gcfg. Environment variables exchange_KEY and exchange_SECRET are needed for each exchange.
